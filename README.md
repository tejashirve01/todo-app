# Todo App

A simple full-stack Todo application built with Node.js (Express & MongoDB) for the backend and React (Vite) for the frontend.

## About Our Project

This project is a Todo application that allows you to create, view, and update tasks. The backend is built using Node.js with Express and MongoDB for data storage, and it uses [Zod](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod) for input validation. The frontend is built using React, powered by Vite, to provide a fast development experience.

## How to Clone the Repository

1. Open your terminal.
2. Run the following command to clone the repo:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tejashirve01/todo-app.git
Navigate into the project directory:

cd todo-app

How to Install Dependencies
The project has two separate parts: the backend and the frontend. You will need to install dependencies in each folder.

Backend
Navigate to the backend directory:

cd backend

Install the Node.js dependencies:

npm install

Frontend
Open a new terminal window or tab and navigate to the frontend directory:

cd frontend

Install the Node.js dependencies:

npm install

How to Run the Application
Running the Backend
In the backend directory, start the server:

node index.js
The backend server should now be running at http://localhost:3000.

Running the Frontend
In the frontend directory, start the development server:

npm run dev

The Vite development server should open your default browser or you can visit http://localhost:5173 (the port might vary).

Notes
Ensure you have Node.js installed.

The backend uses MongoDB. Make sure your connection string in backend/db.js is correct and you have access to the MongoDB instance.

The project uses React DevTools for a better development experience. If you havenâ€™t installed it yet, consider downloading it from here.
